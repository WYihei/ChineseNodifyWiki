# Make items draggable

The ```DragBehavior.IsDraggable="True"``` attached property will enable dragging and raise the following events:
* DragBehavior.DragStartedEvent - when the mouse is moved for the first time
* DragBehavior.DragDeltaEvent - while the left mouse button is down and the mouse is moving
* DragBehavior.DragCompletedEvent - when the left mouse button is up and the control moved

These events are handled by the ```NodifyEditor``` which will move only the ```SelectedItems``` which are ```ItemContainer```s generated by the ```ItemsSource``` that have their ```IsSelected``` dependency property set to true.

If you want your control to be draggable outside the NodifyEditor, you must handle the raised events.

The ```DragBehavior.DraggableHost``` attached property can specify a host control to use when calculating the drag delta. This is useful when the control is inside a panel that uses a custom ```RenderTransform``` or a ```LayoutTransform```.
If a value is not specified, it will try to find a ```NodifyCanvas``` in the parent hierarchy and if that fails it look for a ```Canvas``` which will fallback to the element itself if not found.
